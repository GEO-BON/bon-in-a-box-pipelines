script: protconn_analysis.R
name: Protconn Analysis
description: This script calculates the Protected Connected Index (ProtConn) from protected area polygons using the MK_ProtConn function in the Makurhini package. This creates a distance matrix from protected area polygons and calculates ProtConn using dispersal probabilities between protected areas.

  distance_threshold:
    label: Distance analysis threshold
    description: >
      Refers to the threshold distance (in meters) used to estimate if the areas are connected in a spatial analysis.
      This threshold represents the median dispersal probability (i.e. where the dispersal probability between patches is 0.5).
      Dispersal probability is calculated with an exponential decay function with increasing distance.


      Common dispersal distances that encompass a large majority of terrestrial species are 1000 meters, 3000 meters, 10,000 meters, and 100,000 meters (Saura et al. 2017).


      Note that the more distances you include, the longer the pipeline will take to complete and the more memory it will require.
      Additionally, larger dispersal distances will be more computationally intensive.
    type: int[]
    example: [1000, 10000]
  pa_size_threshold:
    label: PA size threshold
    description: Size threshold for PAs, in meters squared. Protected areas smaller than this area will be removed. A threshold of 1km2 was used in
     Saura et al. 2017 because at larger scales, protected areas less than 1km2 (1000 m2) do not have a large impact on ProtConn values. Removing small protected areas
     significantly speeds up calculation and is recommended for large areas. To not PAs filter by size threshold, input a value of 0.

    example: 1000
  years:
    label: Year for cutoff
    description: Year for which you want ProtConn calculated (e.g. an input of 2000 will calculate ProtConn for only PAs
      that were designated before the year 2000)

    label: Start year
    description: Year for the time series plot to start. Missing dates for protected area establishment will be automatically assigned to 
      this year for the time series analysis. Leave blank if time series is not selected.
    type: int
    example: 1980
  year_int:
    label: Year interval
    description: Year interval for the time series plot of ProtConn values (e.g. an input of 20 will calculate ProtConn for every 20 years by filtering out protected areas established before that year).
     The last year will always be the input year. Leave blank if time series is not selected.

    example: 20
