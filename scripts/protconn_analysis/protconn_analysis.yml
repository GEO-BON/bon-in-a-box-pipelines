name: Protconn Analysis
description: This script calculates ProtConn from protected area polygons using the MK_ProtConn function in the Makurhini package. This creates a distance matrix from protected area polygons and calculates ProtConn using dispersal probabilities between protected areas.

inputs:
  study_area_polygon:
    label: Polygon of study area
    description: Polygon of the study area, in GeoPackage format. To use a custom study area, input the path to the file in the userdata folder (e.g. /userdata/study_area_polygon.gpkg) and it
      will override the country polygon from the "Get country polygon" script.
    type: application/geopackage+sqlite3[]
    example: null
  protected_area_polygon:
    label: Polygon of protected areas
    description: The protected areas (PAs) of interest. To combine WDPA data and custom data, add the path to the custom geopkg here. They will be combined within the script.
    type: application/geopackage+sqlite3[]
    example: null
  date_column_name:
    label: Date column name
    description: Name of the column in the user provided protected area file that specifies when the PA was created (leave blank if only using WDPA data).
    type: text
    example: null
  crs:
    label: Coordinate reference system
    description: Coordinate reference system for the study area and protected areas. Must be in a projected reference system (not EPSG:4326). To find the reference system for your region visit [epsg.io](https://epsg.io/).
    type: text
    example: "EPSG:4326"
  distance_threshold:
    label: Distance analysis threshold
    description: >
      Refers to the threshold distance (in meters) used to estimate if the areas are connected in a spatial analysis.
      This threshold represents the median dispersal probability (i.e. where the dispersal probability between patches is 0.5).
      Dispersal probability is calculated with an exponential decay function with increasing distance.


      Common dispersal distances that encompass many different taxa are 1000 meters, 10,000 meters, and 100,000 meters.


      Note that the more distances you include, the longer the pipeline will take to complete and the more memory it will require.
      Additionally, larger dispersal distances will be more computationally intensive.
    type: int[]
    example: [1000, 10000]
  distance_matrix_type:
    label: Type of distance matrix
    description: >
      Type of distance matrix to use in the ProtConn calculation. The "centroid" option will measure the
      distances between protected areas from the geometric center of each protected area,
      while the "edge" option will measure the distance as the nearest edge between two protected areas.
    type: options
    options:
      - centroid
      - edge
    example: centroid
  years:
    label: Year for cutoff
    description: Year for which you want ProtConn calculated (e.g. an input of 2000 will calculate ProtConn for only PAs
      that were designated before the year 2000)
    type: int
    example: 2025
  start_year:
    label: Start year
    description: Year for the time series plot to start
    type: int
    example: 1980
  year_int:
    label: Year interval
    description: Year interval for the time series plot of ProtConn values (e.g. an input of 20 will calculate ProtConn for every 20 years by filtering out protected areas established before that year).
    type: int
    example: 20
outputs:
  protected_areas:
    label: Protected areas
    description: Protected areas on which ProtConn has been calculated. Overlapping protected areas have been merged
      into one to speed up calculation.
    type: application/geopackage+sqlite3[]
  protconn_result:
    label: ProtConn results
    description: >
      The results of the ProtConn calculations, including the percentage of the study area that is unprotected and protected,
      and the percentage that is protected and connected (ProtConn) and protected and unconnected (ProtUnconn).
    type: text/csv
  result_plot:
    label: ProtConn result plot
    description: >
      Donut plot of the percentage of total area that is unprotected, protected-connected, and protected-unconnected
      for each input dispersal distance (in meters).
    type: image/png
  result_yrs_plot:
    label: ProtConn time series plot
    description: Change in the percentage area that is protected and the percentage that is protected and connected over time,
      at the chosen time interval, compared to the Kunming-Montreal GBF goals.
    type: image/png[]
  result_yrs:
    label: ProtConn time series results
    description: Table of the time series of ProtConn and ProtUnconn values, calculated at the time interval that is specified
