script: protconn_analysis.R
name: Protconn Analysis
description: This script calculates ProtConn from protected area polygons using the MK_ProtConn function in the Makurhini package. This creates a distance matrix from protected area polygons and calculates ProtConn using dispersal probabilities between protected areas.

inputs:
  study_area_polygon:
    label: Polygon of study area
    description: Represents the map of the study area
    type: application/geo+json
    example: null
  protected_area_polygon:
    label: Polygon of protected areas
    description: Represents the map of the protected areas within the study area
    type: application/geo+json
    example: null
  studyarea_epsg:
    label: Study area EPSG
    description: Numerical value referring to the EPSG code (European Petroleum Survey Group) associated with the spatial reference system that will be used as a reference for the study area. This numerical value specifies the projection and geodetic datum used to define the coordinates and spatial representation of the data in the study area. This MUST be in a projected reference system (not lat long). For further information on coordinate systems and EPSG codes, you can access the official database on the EPSG website at https://epsg.org/home.html. The website provides documentation, resources, and tools for searching and understanding the EPSG codes used in various geospatial contexts.
    type: int
    example: 3116
  distance_threshold:
    label: Distance analysis threshold
    description: Refers to the threshold distance (in meters) used to estimate if the areas are connected in a spatial analysis. This threshold represent the median dispersal probability (i.e. where the dispersal probabilty between patches is 0.5). Dispersal probability is calculated with an exponential decay function with increasing distance.
    type: int
    example: 10000
  transboundary_distance:
    label: Transboundary distance
    description: Distance (in chosen distance unit) beyond the boundary of the study area to be included in the ProtConn index. Protected areas within this distance of the edge of the study area will be included in the calculation of ProtConn. A transboundary distance of 0 will only include protected areas in the study area.
    type: int
    example: 0
  distance_matrix_type:
    label: Type of distance matrix
    description: String value that defines whether the user wants to use a distance matrix of centroids or the nearest edge for the ProtConn calculation
    type: options
    options:
      - "centroid"
      - "edge"
    example: "centroid"
  date_column_name:
    label: Date column name
    description: Name of the column in the protected area file that specifies when the PA was created (STATUS_YR for WDPA data)
    type: text
    example: STATUS_YR
  years:
    label: Year for cutoff
    description: Year for which you want ProtConn calculated (e.g. an input of 2000 will calculate ProtConn for only PAs that were designated before the year 2000)
    type: int
    example: 2024
  start_year:
    label: Start year
    description: Year for the time series plot to start
    type: int
    example: 1950
  year_int:
    label: Year interval
    description: Year interval for the time series plot of ProtConn values (e.g. an input of 10 will calculate ProtConn for every 10 years)
    type: int
    example: 20
outputs:
  protcon_result:
    label: ProtConn results
    description: Contains the results of the connectivity analysis between the spatial units within the study area. This table provides valuable information about the spatial relationships and connectivity patterns among different spatial entities
    type: text/csv
  result_plot:
    label: ProtConn result plot
    description: Donut plot of the percentage of total area that is protected and percentage of the total area that is protected and connected
    type: image/png
  result_yrs_plot:
    label: ProtConn time series plot
    description: Change in the percentage area that is protected and the percentage that is protected and connected over time
    type: image/png
  result_yrs:
    label: ProtConn time series results
    description: Table of the time series of ProtConn and ProtUnconn values, calculated at the time interval that is specified
    type: text/csv
  result_preset_plot:
    label: ProtConn plot with dispersal presets
    description: Plot of ProtConn calcuated with three common dispersal values, 1km, 10km, and 100km
