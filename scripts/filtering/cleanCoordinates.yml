script: cleanCoordinates.R
description: "This script enables to apply several cleaning filters to the observations. The tests equal,
     zeros, duplicates, same_pixel, capitals, centroids, seas, urban, gbif and institutions are wrappers around CoordinateCleaner functions.
     Test same_pixel remove points inside the same pixel, based on a provided raster or from a STAC catalogue. Test env allows removing environmental outliers using the 
     the Reverse Jackknife procedure as described by Chapman (2005) and adapted from the package biogeo."
