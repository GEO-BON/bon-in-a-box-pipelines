script: climateMetrics.R
description: This script calculates climate rarity, using a moving window approach. Values close to zero indicate that mean temperature is rare compare with its surrounding region. Values close to 1 indicate that mean temperature is common compare with its surrounding region.
inputs:
  metric:
    label: metric climate rarity
    description: how different is the mean temperature from its surroundings, using moving window and a temperature threshold.
