  This script calculates and summarizes the NDVI for every pixel within a given region and for a selected
  time period using the red and near-infrared bands from the [Sentinel-2 data](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/sentinel-data/sentinel-2),
   with a cloud mask. The data is pulled using the OpenEO Python client connected to the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem backend. The resulting
   raster will give you a meaningful and cloud-free vegetation index.
inputs:
  bbox_crs:
    label: CRS
    description: Object containing the chosen bounding box and CRS.
    type: bboxCRS
  study_area_polygon:
    label: Polygon of study area
    description: Polygon of the study area of interest
    type: application/geopackage+sqlite3
    example: null
  start_date:
    label: Start date
    description: Start date for summarizing vegetation index
    type: text
    example: "2019-05-01"
  end_date:
    label: End date
    description: End date for summarizing vegetation index
    type: text
    example: "2019-09-30"
  spatial_resolution:
    label: Spatial resolution
    description: Spatial resolution of the raster for plotting, leave blank to have the original spatial resolution of the layer (10m x 10m).
      If using a projected CRS, the resolution should be in meters. If using an unprojected CRS (e.g. EPSG:4326), this must be in degrees (0.008 degrees is ~1km at the equator).
    type: float
    example: 100
  summary_statistic:
    label: Summary statistic
    description: Statistic to summarize layers over time for summarised raster layer and space for plot of ndvi means over time
    type: options
    options:
      - mean
      - median
      - max
      - min
    example: mean
outputs:
  rasters:
    label: Vegetation index rasters
    description: |
      Raster of the NDVI values summarised by the input statistic (mean, max, min, median) for each pixel within the time span choosen. If multiple indices were chosen, each band corresponds to a different vegetation index
    type: image/tiff;application=geotiff[]
  timeseries:
    label: Time series of NDVI
    description: Time series of NDVI values for every date where there is data in the specified time period.
    type: text/csv
