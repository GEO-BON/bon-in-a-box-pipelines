  This script produces 1) the Species Habitat Index time series, by averaging the Species Habitat Scores; 
  2) the Steward’s Species Habitat Index, by averaging the Species Habitat Scores weighted by the proportion 
  between the area of habitat for the study area and the total range map of the species.

      This is weighted by the proportion between the area of habitat for the study area and 
      the total range map of the species. The reference year will start at the proportion of area of habitat 
      in the study area. For example, if half of the species habitat is covered by the study area, 
      the reference year’s value will be 50%.
