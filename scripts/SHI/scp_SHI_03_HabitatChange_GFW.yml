script: scp_SHI_03_HabitatChange_GFW.R
name: Measure habitat change
description: 
  This script loads the area of habitat of the species and the Global Forest Watch (GFW) layers to measure changes on the habitat of the species.
  It uses the layers the 2000 forest layer as a reference and removes the pixels from the loss layer of GFW data.

    label: spatial reference system
    description: Reference system for the area of interest. It can be 
      1) the Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID),
