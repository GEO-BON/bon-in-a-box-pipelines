script: habitatChange_GFW.R
name: Measure habitat change
description:
  This script loads the area of habitat of the species and the Global Forest Watch (GFW) layers to measure changes on the habitat of the species.
  It uses the layers the 2000 forest layer as a reference and removes the pixels from the loss layer of GFW data.

  spat_res:
    label: output spatial resolution
    description: Spatial resolution (in meters) for the output of the analysis.
    type: float
    example: 1000
  srs:
    label: spatial reference system
    description: Reference system for the area of interest. It can be
      1) the Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID),
      2) the authority name (e.g. EPSG) with the SRID or
      3) the description of the spatial reference system details (e.g. [https://spatialreference.org/]).

      If just the SRID is given and the software can not find the reference system, try options 2 or 3.
    type: text
    example: EPSG:3116
  species:
    label: species
    description: Scientific name of the species. Multiple species names can be specified, separated with a comma.
    type: text[]
    example:
      [
        "Myrmecophaga tridactyla"
      ]
  r_area_of_habitat:
    label: area of habitat
    description: Raster file with the area of habitat for each species.
    type: image/tiff;application=geotiff[]

      ]
  min_forest:
    label: min forest
    description: Minimum tree cover percentage required for each species, based on suitable habitat of the species.
      Acts as a filter for the Global Forest Watch Data.
      If not available, use Map of Life Values (e.g. [https://mol.org/species/range/Myrmecophaga-tridactyla]). For multiple species, input in the same order as input in species and separate with a comma.
    type: int[]
    example:
      [
        0
      ]
  max_forest:
    label: max forest
    description: Maximum tree cover percentage required for each species, based on suitable habitat of the species.
      Acts as a filter for the Global Forest Watch Data.
      If not available, use Map of Life Values (e.g. [https://mol.org/species/range/Myrmecophaga-tridactyla]). For multiple species, input in the same order as input in species and separate with a comma.

      [
        100
      ]
  t_0:
    label: initial time

    type: int
    example: 2000
  t_n:
    label: final time
    description: Year where the analysis should end (it should be later than Initial time). It should be inside the time interval for the
      Global Forest Watch data at https://stac.geobon.org/collections/gfw-lossyear.
    type: int
    example: 2020
  time_step:
    label: time step
    description: Temporal resolution for analysis given in number of years.
      To get values for the end year, time step should fit evenly into the given analysis range.
