description:
  This script produces 1) the Species Habitat Index time series, by averaging the Species Habitat Scores;
  2) the Steward’s Species Habitat Index, by averaging the Species Habitat Scores weighted by the proportion
  between the area of habitat for the study area and the total range map of the species.

      [
        "/scripts/SHI/Myrmecophaga tridactyla_SHS_table_tidy.tsv",

      ]
  df_aoh_areas:
    label: table with size of areas of reference.
    description: A TSV (Tab Separated Values) file containing the area of the range map loaded (area_range_map), the size of the study area (area_study_a), the area of the bounding box for the analysis (area_bbox_analysis), size of the buffer used to create the bounding box for the analysis, the size of the area of habitat(area_aoh).

  df_shi:
    label: SHI table
    description: Table with SHI and Steward’s SHI values for the complete area of study.
    type: text/tab-separated-values

    label: SHI time series
    description: Figure showing a time series of SHI values for each time step, 100% being equal to the reference year.

    description: Figure showing a time series of Steward’s SHI values for each time step.
      This is weighted by the proportion between the area of habitat for the study area and
      the total range map of the species. The reference year will start at the proportion of area of habitat
      in the study area. For example, if half of the species habitat is covered by the study area,
      the reference year’s value will be 50%.
