inputs:
  species:
    label: species
    description: Scientific name of the species.
    type: text
    example: Saguinus oedipus
  srs:
    label: spatial reference system
    description: Reference system for the area of interest. It can be 1) the Spatial Reference System Identifier (SRID), 2) the authority name (e.g. EPSG) with the SRID or 3) the description of the spatial reference system details (e.g. [https://spatialreference.org/]). If just the SRID is given and the software can not find the reference system try options 2 or 3.
    type: text
    example: EPSG:3116
  elev_buffer:
    label: elevation buffer
    description: Elevation buffer in meters to add (or substract) to the reported species elevation range. Default is zero. Positive values will increase the range in that magnitude and negative values will reduce the range in that magnitude.
    type: int
    example: 0
  min_forest:
    label: min forest
    description: Minimum tree cover percentage required, based on suitable habitat of the species. Acts as a filter for the Global Forest Watch Data. If not available, use Map of Life Values (e.g. [https://mol.org/species/range/Saguinus_oedipus]) 
    type: int
    example: 50
  max_forest:
    label: max forest
    description: Maximum tree cover percentage required, based on suitable habitat of the species. Acts as a filter for the Global Forest Watch Data. If not available, use Map of Life Values (e.g. [https://mol.org/species/range/Saguinus_oedipus]) 
    type: int
    example: 100
  country_code:
    label: country code
    description: Three letter code (ISO_3166-1_alpha-3 [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search]) for the country where the analysis will be done.
    type: text
    example: COL
  region:
    label: region
    description: For cases when a more specific administrative boundary (than the country level) is required, a region name can be used. This name should be aligned with the codification from the GADM data [https://gadm.org/metadata.html] for the variable NAME_1 (check gadm function in R from the geodata package [https://rdrr.io/github/rspatial/geodata/man/gadm.html])
    type: text
    example: null
  spat_res:
    label: output spatial resolution
    description: Spatial resolution (in meters) for the output of the analysis.
    type: int
    example: 1000
  expert_source:
    label: source of expert range map
    description: Source of the expert range map for the species.
    type: options
    options:
      - MOL
      - IUCN
      - QC
    example: IUCN
  t_0:
    label: initial time
    description: Year where the analysis should start. Global Forest Watch data is available from the year 2000 to 2020.
    type: int
    example: 2000
  t_n:
    label: final time
    description: Year where the analysis should end (it should be later than Initial time)
    type: int
    example: 2020
  time_step:
    label: time step
    description: Temporal resolution for analysis given in number of years. To get values for the end year, time step should fit evenly into the given analysis range.
    type: int
    example: 1
outputs:
  df_shi:
    label: shi table
    description: A TSV (Tab Separated Values) file containing Habitat Score, Connectivity Score, and SHI by time step.
