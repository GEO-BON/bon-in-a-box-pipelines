    label: With IDs
    description: Config containing the ids. The an id will be replaced by the corresponding layer in with_layers output.

  identified_layers:
    label: id+layer
    description: A list of objects containing an id (text) and a layer (image/tiff;application=geotiff) as produced by AssignId.
    type: object[]
    properties:
      - id
      - layer
    example: [
      { id: "firstId", layer: "path/to/my/layer1.tiff" },
      { id: "secondId", layer: "path/to/my/layer2.tiff" },
      { id: "thirdId", layer: "path/to/my/layer3.tiff" },
      { id: "fourthId", layer: "path/to/my/layer4.tiff" }
    ]

outputs:
  with_layers:
    label: With layers
    description: The initial config, where ids have been replaced by layers.
    type: text
