script: spatial_to_DistanceMatrix.R
name: distances matrix
description: This script calculates a distance matrix between spatial units from a spatial file. It reads the spatial data from the file, which contains the geographic information of the spatial units, such as their boundaries or centroids

inputs:
  studyarea_country:
    label: Country
    description: Country in which to calculate ProtConn. Must be capitalized. List of available countries here https://geoio.biodiversite-quebec.ca/docs#/default/country_list_country_list_get. 
    type: string
    example: Colombia
  studyarea_state:
    label: State/Province
    description: State or province in which to calculate ProtConn. List of available states/provinces here https://geoio.biodiversite-quebec.ca/docs#/default/state_list_state_list_get. If left blank, will calculate ProtConn for the whole country.

    example: null
  studyarea_epsg:
    label: study area EPSG
    description: Numerical value referring to the EPSG code (European Petroleum Survey Group) associated with the spatial reference system that will be used as a reference for the study area. This numerical value specifies the projection and geodetic datum used to define the coordinates and spatial representation of the data in the study area. For further information on coordinate systems and EPSG codes, you can access the official database on the EPSG website at https://epsg.org/home.html. The website provides documentation, resources, and tools for searching and understanding the EPSG codes used in various geospatial contexts.
    type: int
    example: 3395
  unit_distance:
    label: unit for distance measurement
    description: String value that defines the measurement unit for calculating distances between spatial units (m or km) and estimating their areas (m2 or km2) in the study area.
    type: options
    options:
      - m
      - km
    example: "m"
  column_group:
    label: name of grouping attribute
    description: String that refers to the name of the column in the spatial file with the levels used to define the spatial units. In cases where there are multiple polygons per level, they will be grouped together, and the attributes of the first listed polygon will be taken into account.
    type: text[]
    example: ["WDPA_PID"]
outputs:
  spatialunits_studyarea:
    label: intersect spatial units/study area
    description: Represents the map of the analyzed spatial units within the study area.
    type: application/geo+json
  spatialunits_studyarea_data:
    label: spatial units study area data
    description: Refers to the dataset containing information about the spatial units analyzed within the study area.
    type: text/csv
  mtx_distance_centroid:
    label: distance centroid matrix
    description: Distance matrix that represents the distances between the centroids of spatial units within the study area. Each element in the matrix denotes the distance between the centroid of one spatial unit and the centroid of another
    type: text/csv
  mtx_distance_nearest:
    label: distance nearest matrix
    description: Distance matrix that represents the distances between the closest boundaries of spatial units within the study area. Each element in the matrix denotes the distance between the boundary of one spatial unit and the boundary of another.
    type: text/csv
  spatial_unit:
    label: spatial unit
    description: Refers to the column in the spatialunits_studyarea_data that denotes the spatial entity or geographic unit used for analysis. This column contains information about the spatial units that have been grouped based on the levels provided in the column_group input.
    type: text
  column_area:
    label: column area
    description: Refers to the column in the dataset that contains the estimated area for each of the spatial units under analysis. The estimation is expressed in square units (m2 or km2), as defined by the input unit_distance.
    type: text
  area_study_area:
    label: total study area
    description: Refers to the total area of the analyzed study area. The estimation of this area is expressed in square units (m2 or km2) as defined by the input unit_distance.
    type: int
  area_unit:
    label: area unit
    description: Refers to the unit of measurement used for representing area in square units. The specific unit, whether square meters (m2) or square kilometers (km2), is determined by the input value provided for unit_distance.
    type: options
    options:
      - m2
      - km2
  distance_unit:
    label: distance unit
    description: Refers to the unit of measurement used for representing area in linear units. The specific unit, whether square (m) or kilometers (km), is determined by the input value provided for unit_distance.
