inputs:
  auk_covars_file:
    label: auk_covars_file
    description: "Input data with eBird data and covars"
    type: dataframe
    example:  "scripts/00_eBird_format/input/ebird_zf_covs.txt"
  min_obs:
    label: min_obs
    description: "Minimum number of observations required for each site."
    type: int
    example:  1
  max_obs:
    label: max_obs
    description: "Maximum number of observations allowed for each site."
    type: int
    example: 10
  annual_closure:
    label: annual_closure
    description: "Whether the entire year should be treated as the period of closure (the default). This can be useful, for example, if the data have been subset to a period of closure prior to calling"
    type: logical
    example:  FALSE
  n_days:
    label: n_days
    description: "Number of days defining the temporal length of closure. If annual_closure = TRUE closure periods will be split at year boundaries. If annual_closure = FALSE the closure periods will ignore year boundaries."
    type: int
    example: 30
  date_var:
    label: date_var
    description: "Column name of the variable in x containing the date. This column should either be in Date format or convertible to Date format with as.Date()."
    type: text
    example: "observation_date"
  site_vars:
    label: site_vars
    description: "Names of one of more columns in x that define a site, typically the location (e.g. latitude/longitude) and observer ID."
    type: text
    example: "ID"
  site_id:
    label: site_id
    description: "A unique idenitifer for each 'site', typically identifying observations from a unique location by the same observer within a period of temporal closure. Data output from filter_repeat_visits() will have a .site_id variable that meets these requirements."
    type: text
    example: "site"
  response:
    label: response
    description: "The variable that will act as the response in modeling efforts, typically a binary variable indicating presence or absence or a count of individuals seen."
    type: text
    example: "species_observed"
  site_covs:
    label: site_covs
    description: "the variables that will act as site-level covariates, i.e. covariates that vary at the site level, for example, latitude/longitude or habitat predictors. If this parameter is missing, it will be assumed that any variable that is not an observation-level covariate (obs_covs) or the site_id, is a site-level covariate."
    type: text
    example: "huella"
  obs_covs:
    label: obs_covs
    description: "The variables that will act as observation-level covariates, i.e. covariates that vary within sites, at the level of observations, for example, time or length of observation."
    type: text
    example: "duration_minutes"
outputs:
  occ_wide_export:
    label: occ_wide_export
    description: "Data frame prepared of species observations for ingestion into the package unmarked for hierarchical modeling of abundance and occurrence. "
