script: protcon_analyisis.R
description: "This script a connectivity analysis between spatial units (ej. protected areas) using a distance matrix within a specified study area. It identifies connected pairs of spatial units based on a specified distance threshold and generates a connectivity table with connectivity status"
inputs:
  mtx_distance:
    label: mtx_distance
    description: String path that represents the file location of a distance matrix containing distances between spatial units. The unit of distance in which it is defined is explicitly specified in the unit_distance input (m or km). 
    type: text/csv
    example: "/scripts/00_protcon_analyisis/input/mtx_distance_centroid.csv"
  area_study_area:
    label: area_study_area
    description: Refers to the total area of the analyzed study area. The unit of area in which it is defined is explicitly specified as the square of the unit_distance input (m2 or km2). 
    type: int
    example: 11000000000
  distance_analysis:
    label: distance_analysis
    description: Refers to the threshold distance used to estimate if the areas are connected in a spatial analysis. This threshold value defines the maximum distance allowed between two spatial units for them to be considered as connected or neighboring. he unit of distance in which it is defined is explicitly specified in the unit_distance input (m or km).
    type: int
    example: 10000
  unit_distance:
    label: unit_distance
    description: Refers to the distance measurement unit (m or km) used to estimate connectivity between spatial analysis units. It defines the distance threshold for determining whether areas are considered connected.
    type: options
    options:
      - m
      - km
    example: "m"
  data_spatial_unit:
    label: data_spatial_unit 
    description: "String refers to the path string where the .csv file containing information required for the calculation of the indicator is located. There must be an ID for each spatial unit, name (if any) and the area of each one of them. If the analysis is done in time, specify a date, for example if the spatial units or nodes are protected areas, specify the date of their declaration."
    type: text/csv
    example: "/scripts/00_protcon_analyisis/input/spatialunits_studyarea_data.csv"
  column_spatial_unit:
    label: column_spatial_unit 
    description: "String that refers to the name of the column in the spatial file with the levels used to define the spatial units. In cases where there are multiple polygons per level, they will be grouped together, and the attributes of the first listed polygon will be taken into account."
    type: text
    example: "spatial_unit"
  column_area:
    label: column_area 
    description: Text string representing the file path to the spatial file containing the spatial boundaries pertaining to the study area. Accepted file types include shapefile (.shp), raster (.tif/GeoTIFF) or  GeoPackage (.gpkg). This path specifies the complete path location of the file within the file system and is utilized for identifying and accessing the spatial boundaries contained within the file.
    type: text
    example: "area_spatial_unit"
  column_date:
    label: column_date 
    description: String that refers to the name of the column in the data_spatial_unit containing the date or time information corresponding to the spatial unit levels.
    type: text
    example: "created_date"
  time_interval:
    label: time_interval
    description: Represents the periods or intervals used for analysis. It specifies the length and units of time that will be considered for analyzing the data. For example, time intervals like 10Y (10 years), 5Y (5 years), 4M (4 months) can be used to define the time granularity for conducting the analysis.
    type: text
    example: "10Y"
  time_start:
    label: time_start
    description: Refers to the starting date of the time_interval. If this value is null or not provided, the minimum date from the column_date will be automatically taken as the starting date for the analysis
    type: text
    example: 'NULL'
  time_end:
    label: time_end
    description: Refers to the ending date of the time_interval. If this value is null or not provided, the minimum date from the column_date will be automatically taken as the starting date for the analysis
    type: text
    example: 'NULL'
outputs:
  protcon_result:
    label: protcon_result
    description: "Contains the results of the connectivity analysis between the spatial units within the study area. This table provides valuable information about the spatial relationships and connectivity patterns among different spatial entities"
