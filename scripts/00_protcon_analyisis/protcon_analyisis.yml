script: protcon_analyisis.R
description: "This script lest run a connectivity analysis between spatial units (ej. protected areas or patches of habitat). It identifies the percentage of protected areas that are well connected given a distance and consultation area determine by the user."
inputs:
  mtx_distance:
    label: mtx_distance
    description: "String path indicating the .csv file location of the distance matrix between all spatial units that intersect the query area. It must be a symmetric array and can be distance from the center or nearest edge of each spatial unit. This input can be provided by the user or calculated within the pipeline."
    type: text/csv
    example: "/scripts/00_protcon_analyisis/input/mtx_distance_centroid.csv"
  area_study_area:
    label: area_study_area
    description: "Number refers to the total area of the area of interest. Check that the area units are the same as those used in the data_spatial_unit parameter."
    type: int
    example: 11000000000
  distance_analysis:
    label: distance_analysis
    description: "Number refers to the distance in which the spatial units are considered to be well connected, this can vary if it is about the dispersal of a species, political decision or another specific objective."
    type: int
    example: 10000
  unit_distance:
    label: unit_distance
    description: "String refers to the unit of the distance for the analysis (ej m for meters or km for kilometer)."
    type: options
    options:
      - m
      - km
    example: "m"
  data_spatial_unit:
    label: data_spatial_unit 
    description: "String refers to the path string where the .csv file containing information required for the calculation of the indicator is located. There must be an ID for each spatial unit, name (if any) and the area of each one of them. If the analysis is done in time, specify a date, for example if the spatial units or nodes are protected areas, specify the date of their declaration."
    type: text
    example: "/scripts/00_protcon_analyisis/input/spatialunits_studyarea_data.csv"
  column_spatial_unit: "String that refers to the name of the column in the data_spatial_unit file that contains the unique identifier ID of the spatial units that intersect the area of interest. These IDs must be equivalent to the column and row names in the distance matrix."
    label: column_spatial_unit 
    description: 
    type: text
    example: "id_pa"
  column_area:
    label: column_area 
    description: "String refering to the name of the column in the data_spatial_unit file that contains the area of each spatial unit that intersects the area of interest. Values in this column must be numeric otherwise they will be ignored."
    type: text
    example: "area_spatial"
  column_date:
    label: column_date 
    description: "String refering to the name of the column that contains the date. The date is a mandatory field if you want an analysis by time periods.The date is a mandatory field if you want an analysis by time periods for example the year in which a protected area is declared or the year in which the forest patch layer is produced."
    type: text
    example: "created_date"
  format_date:
    label: format_date 
    description: "String refering to the date format of the column_date field. For example "%Y-%m-%d", which represents "year-month-day"."
    type: text
    example: "%Y-%m-%d"
  time_interval:
    label: time_interval
    description: "String refering to the periods or intervals used for analysis. It specifies the length and units of time that will be considered for analyzing the data. For example, time intervals like 10Y (10 years), 5Y (5 years), 4M (4 months) can be used to define the time granularity for conducting the analysis. If no interval (time_interval) is specified, "1Y" is used by default."
    type: text
    example: "10Y"
  time_start:
    label: time_start
    description: "Refering to the starting date of the time_interval. If this value is null or not provided, the minimum date from the column_date will be automatically taken as the starting date for the analysis. This argument is ignored if column_date=NULL."
    type: text
    example: NA
  time_end:
    label: time_end
    description: "Refers to the ending date of the time_interval. If this value is null or not provided, the minimum date from the column_date will be automatically taken as the starting date for the analysis. This argument is ignored if column_date=NULL."
