script: protcon_analyisis.R
description: "This script lest run a connectivity analysis between spatial units (ej. protected areas or patches of habitat). It identifies the percentage of protected areas that are well connected given a distance and consultation area determine by the user."
inputs:
  mtx_distance:
    label: mtx_distance
    description: "String path indicating the .csv file location of the distance matrix between all spatial units that intersect the query area. It must be a symmetric array and can be distance from the center or nearest edge of each spatial unit. This input can be provided by the user or calculated within the pipeline."
    type: text/csv
    example: "/scripts/00_protcon_analyisis/input/mtx_distance_centroid.csv"
  area_study_area:
    label: area_study_area
    description: "It refers to the total area of the area of interest."
    type: int
    example: 11000000000
  distance_analysis:
    label: distance_analysis
    description: "It refers to the distance in which the spatial units are considered to be well connected, this can vary if it is about the dispersal of a species, political decision or another specific objective."
    type: int
    example: 10000
  unit_distance:
    label: unit_distance
    description: "The unit in which the distance between the spatial units and the input study area is found must be specified (eg m for meters or km for kilometer)."
    type: options
    options:
      - m
      - km
    example: "m"
  data_spatial_unit:
    label: data_spatial_unit 
    description: "It refers to the path string where the .csv file containing information required for the calculation of the indicator is located. There must be an ID for each spatial unit, name (if any) and the area of each one of them."
    type: text
    example: "/scripts/00_protcon_analyisis/input/spatialunits_studyarea_data.csv"
  column_spatial_unit: "A string that refers to the name of the column in the data_spatial_unit file that contains the unique identifier ID of the spatial units that intersect the area of interest. These IDs must be equivalent to the column and row names in the distance matrix."
    label: column_spatial_unit 
    description: 
    type: text
    example: "id_pa"
  column_area:
    label: column_area 
    description: "A string that refers to the name of the column in the data_spatial_unit file that contains the area of each spatial unit that intersects the area of interest."
    type: text
    example: "area_spatial"
  column_date:
    label: column_date 
    description: "String that refers to the name of the column in the data_spatial_unit file that contains the date or period in which the information of the spatial units with which the analysis is being performed is produced. For example, the year in which the protected areas were declared or the year in which the layers of forest patches were produced."
    type: text
    example: "created_date"
  format_date:
    label: format_date 
    description: "Refers to the date format of the column_date field. For example "%Y-%m-%d", which represents "year-month-day"."
    type: text
    example: "%Y-%m-%d"
  time_interval:
    label: time_interval
    description: "Represents the periods or intervals used for analysis. It specifies the length and units of time that will be considered for analyzing the data. For example, time intervals like 10Y (10 years), 5Y (5 years), 4M (4 months) can be used to define the time granularity for conducting the analysis. If no interval (time_interval) is specified, "1Y" is used by default."
    type: text
    example: "10Y"
  time_start:
    label: time_start
    description: "Refers to the starting date of the time_interval. If this value is null or not provided, the minimum date from the column_date will be automatically taken as the starting date for the analysis."
    type: text
    example: NA
  time_end:
    label: time_end
    description: "Refers to the ending date of the time_interval. If this value is null or not provided, the minimum date from the column_date will be automatically taken as the starting date for the analysis
    type: text
    example: NA
outputs:
  protcon_result:
    label: protcon_result
    description: "Refers to the table that contains the results of the connectivity analysis between the spatial units within the study area."
