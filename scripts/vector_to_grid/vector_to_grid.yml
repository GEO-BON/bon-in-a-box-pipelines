script: vector_to_grid.R
description: "This script converts the study area layer (shapefile or bounding box) into a spatial grid (well-known text (WKT) representation)."
external_link: https://github.com/GEO-BON/biab-2.0
inputs:
  vector_polygon:
    label: vector_polygon
    description: Text string with the complete path location for the spatial file containing the study area boundaries. Accepted file types include shapefile (.shp), raster (.tif/GeoTIFF), GeoJSON (.json) or  GeoPackage (.gpkg).
    type: application/geo+json[]
    example:  ["/scripts/vector_to_grid/input/Caldas.gpkg"]
  EPSG:
    label: EPSG
    description: Numerical value for the EPSG code (European Petroleum Survey Group) associated with the spatial reference system (projection and geodetic datum) to be used for data in the study area. For further information on coordinate systems and EPSG codes visit https://epsg.org/home.html.
    type: int
    example: 3395
  gridRes_meters:
    label: gridRes_meters
    description: Numerical value referring to the spatial resolution (pixel size) in square meters to create a grid of the study area. This value indicates the level of detail or granularity at which the study area will be analyzed. Each pixel will be considered as a study site for occupancy analyses.
    type: int
    example: 1000
  name_layer:
    label: name_layer
    description: name_layer
    type: text
    example: "ID_grid"
outputs:
  vector_polygon:
    label: vector_polygon
    description: Text string with the complete path location for the spatial file to the study area's raster image (TIFF format) with the chosen projected coordinate system. Use this file for spatial operations and when biological data coordinates are projected to a particular coordinate system.
    type: application/geo+json
  vector_grid:
    label: vector_grid
    description: Text string with the complete path location for the spatial file to the study area's raster image (TIFF format) with the chosen projected coordinate system. Use this file for spatial operations and when biological data coordinates are projected to a particular coordinate system.
