script: 00_spatial_intersects.R
description: "This script calculates a distance matrix between spatial units from a spatial file. It reads the spatial data from the file, which contains the geographic information of the spatial units, such as their boundaries or centroids"

inputs:
  studyarea_wkt:
    label: studyarea_wkt
    description: WKT (Well-Known Text) string or the file path to a .txt file containing the WKT representation of the study area boundaries. The WKT format is a text-based format used to describe the geometry of the study area's boundaries. The structure of the WKT file includes a geometry type label (MULTIPOLYGON), which is associated with the coordinate values of the vertices that define the study area's boundary mask.
    type: text
    example: "/scripts/00_spatial_to_DistanceMatrix/input/wkt_polygon_test.txt"
  studyarea_epsg:
    label: studyarea_EPSG
    description: Numerical value referring to the EPSG code (European Petroleum Survey Group) associated with the spatial reference system that will be used as a reference for the study area. This numerical value specifies the projection and geodetic datum used to define the coordinates and spatial representation of the data in the study area. For further information on coordinate systems and EPSG codes, you can access the official database on the EPSG website at https://epsg.org/home.html. The website provides documentation, resources, and tools for searching and understanding the EPSG codes used in various geospatial contexts.
    type: int
    example: 3395
  spatial_file:
    label: spatial_file
    description: String path represents the file location of a spatial file containing spatial units, which is used to calculate the distance matrix
    type: text
    example: "/scripts/00_spatial_to_DistanceMatrix/input/Colombian_protected_areas.gpkg"
  column_group:
    label: column_group 
    description: String that refers to the name of the column in the spatial file with the levels used to define the spatial units. In cases where there are multiple polygons per level, they will be grouped together, and the attributes of the first listed polygon will be taken into account.
    type: text[]
    example: ["id_pa", "name"]
