description: "Estimate discrete population polygons using distance dispersal thresholds on distance maps from occurrence points within a defined grid map (e.g., study area, species distribution model) to establish spatial boundaries. Hypotheses are based on distance map quantiles. If the species' maximum dispersal distance is known, it can be added as an additional hypothesis; otherwise, only quantile-based hypotheses are generated."
