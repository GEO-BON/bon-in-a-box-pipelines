    label: Coordinate reference system
    description: |
      This input specifies the coordinate reference system of the country polygon output.

      The numerical value refers to the EPSG code (European Petroleum Survey Group) associated with the spatial
      reference system that will be used as a reference for the study area.
      This numerical value specifies the projection and geodetic datum used to define the coordinates and spatial
      representation of the data in the study area.

      For further information on coordinate systems and EPSG codes, you can access the official database on the EPSG
      website at [https://epsg.org/home.html](https://epsg.org/home.html).
      The website provides documentation, resources, and tools for searching and understanding the EPSG codes used in
      various geospatial contexts.
