  stac_url:
    label: STAC URL
    description: URL of the STAC catalog.
    type: text
    example: https://stac.geobon.org/
  bbox:
    label: Bounding box
    description: Vector of float, bbox coordinates of the extent in the order xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax
    type: float[]
    example: [-2316297, -1971146, 1015207, 1511916]
  collections_items:
    label: STAC collection items
    description: Vector of strings, collection name followed by '|' followed by item id
    type: text[]
    example: ["chelsa-clim|bio1", "chelsa-clim|bio2"]
  weight_matrix_with_ids:
    label: Weight matrix with ids
    description: Weight matrix used for BON optimization. Vector of strings, collection name followed by '|' followed by item id, followed by weights. If using the GEO BON Stac catalog, see the list of [available layers here](https://stac.geobon.org/viewer). The collection and item ids can be obtained as the last two parts of the url for each layer (chelsa-clim/bio1). Cannot be used if collection_items is set.

  crs:
    label: Coordinate reference system
    description: |
      Numerical value referring to the EPSG code (European Petroleum Survey Group) associated with the spatial reference system that will be used as a reference for the study area.
      This numerical value specifies the projection and geodetic datum used to define the coordinates and spatial representation of the data in the study area.
      This MUST be in a projected reference system (not lat long).
      
      For further information on coordinate systems and EPSG codes, you can access the official database on the EPSG website at [https://epsg.org/home.html](https://epsg.org/home.html).
      The website provides documentation, resources, and tools for searching and understanding the EPSG codes used in various geospatial contexts.
      
      *Leave blank if you want the bounding box to be in EPSG:4326.*
