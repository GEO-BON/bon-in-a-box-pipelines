inputs:
  bbox_crs:
    label: Bounding box and CRS
    description: Object containing the chosen bounding box and CRS.
    type: bboxCRS
    example:
  stac_url:
    label: STAC URL
    description: URL of the STAC catalog.
    type: text
    example: https://stac.geobon.org/
  collections_items:
    label: STAC collection items
    description: Vector of strings. To pull specific collection items, input the collection name followed by '|' followed by item id (e.g. "chelsa-clim|bio1").
      To extract a whole collection, type the collection name only (e.g. "chelsa-clim"). To pull collection items by date, write the collection name and
      provide a start date, end date, and temporal resolution.
    type: text[]
    example: ["chelsa-clim|bio1", "chelsa-clim|bio2"]
  t0:
    label: Start date
    description: Start date for time series layers. Can be in the format YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD. Leave blank if extracting items by name or to extract layers from all available dates.
    type: text
    example: NULL
  t1:
    label: End date
    description: End date for time series layers. Can be in the format YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD. Leave blank if extracting items by name or to extract layers from all available dates.
    type: text
    example: NULL
  temporal_res:
    label: Temporal resolution
    description: Temporal resolution to use when querying STAC items by date, in the format ("P", time interval, and time unit, e.g.
      "P1Y" is yearly, "P1M" is montly, and "P1D" is daily). Leave blank if not querying by date or if extracting layers from all available dates. If the temporal resolution is
      coarser than the temporal resolution of the time series, the layers will be aggregated with the aggregation method chosen below.
    type: text
    example: NULL
  spatial_res:
    label: Spatial resolution
    description: Integer, spatial resolution of the rasters in the same units as the coordinate reference system
      (meters for projected reference systems and degrees for reference systems in lat long). This input may be blank when using ESPG:4326.
    type: float
    example: NULL
  resampling:
    label: Resampling method
    description: Resampling method used when rescaling and/or reprojecting the raster layers. Will be ignored if no resampling occurs.
      See [gdalwarp](https://gdal.org/en/latest/programs/gdalwarp.html) for description.
