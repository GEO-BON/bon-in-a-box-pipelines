  region:
    label: State/Province
    description: State of interest
    type: text
    example: null
  study_area_polygon: 
    label: Study area polygon
    description: Study area of interest in a geopackage file
    type: application/geopackage+sqlite3
    example: null
  pa_input_type:
    label: Protected area input
    description: Type of input for protected areas. Option "WDPA" uses protected areas from the World Database of Protected Areas. Option "User input" uses polygons input by the user. "Both" combines the WDPA protected areas and user input polygons. 
    type: options
    options:
      - "WDPA"
      - "User input"
      - "Both"
    example: "WDPA"
  transboundary_distance:
    label: Transboundary distance
    description: Distance (in meters) beyond the boundary of the study area to be included in the ProtConn index. Protected areas within this distance of the edge of the study area will be included in the calculation of ProtConn. A transboundary distance of 0 will only include protected areas in the study area. 
    type: int
    example: 0
  protected_area_file: 
    label: Protected areas file
    description: File path of the shapefile of protected areas (Leave blank if using data from WDPA). Must be in geopackage format.
    type: text
    example: null
  date_column_name:
    label: Date column name
    description: Name of the column in the user provided protected area file that specifies when the PA was created (leave blank if only using WDPA data).
    type: text
    example: null
  crs:
    label: Coordinate reference system 
    description: Numerical value referring to the EPSG code (European Petroleum Survey Group) associated with the spatial reference system that will be used as a reference for the study area. This numerical value specifies the projection and geodetic datum used to define the coordinates and spatial representation of the data in the study area. This MUST be in a projected reference system (not lat long). For further information on coordinate systems and EPSG codes, you can access the official database on the EPSG website at https://epsg.org/home.html. The website provides documentation, resources, and tools for searching and understanding the EPSG codes used in various geospatial contexts.
