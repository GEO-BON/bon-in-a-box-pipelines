inputs:
  pa_input_type:
    label: Protected area input
    description: Type of input for protected areas. Option "WDPA" uses protected areas from the World Database of Protected Areas. Option "User input" uses polygons input by the user. "Both" combines the WDPA protected areas and user input polygons. 
    type: options
    options:
      - "WDPA"
      - "User input"
      - "Both"
    example: "WDPA"
  studyarea_country:
    label: Country
    description: Country in which to calculate ProtConn. Must be capitalized. List of available countries here https://geoio.biodiversite-quebec.ca/docs#/default/country_list_country_list_get. 
    type: text
    example: Colombia
  studyarea_state:
    label: State/Province
    description: State or province in which to calculate ProtConn. List of available states/provinces here https://geoio.biodiversite-quebec.ca/docs#/default/state_list_state_list_get. If left blank, will calculate ProtConn for the whole country.
    type: text
    example: null
  transboundary_distance:
    label: Transboundary distance
    description: Distance (in meters) beyond the boundary of the study area to be included in the ProtConn index. Protected areas within this distance of the edge of the study area will be included in the calculation of ProtConn. A transboundary distance of 0 will only include protected areas in the study area. 
    type: int

    label: Protected areas file
    description: File path of the shapefile of protected areas (Leave blank if using data from WDPA)
    type: text
