description: |
  Script to calculate the difference in the layers of the phenology raster layers from the start to end year to show the spatial
  distribution of changes in phenology. The start year is subtracted from the end year, so larger values indicate a larger difference in
  the phenology layers.

      Raster plot of change in phenology from the start year to the end year. The end year is subtracted from the start year, so larger
      values indicate a greater decrease in the given value over time.
