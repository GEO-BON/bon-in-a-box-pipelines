  Summarise yearly phenology data for a country (Europe only) using the copernicus data space ecosystem phenology layer. The script uses the openEO python client to send a job to openEO. 
  The raster has values for the Plant Phenology Index (PPI), which is a vegetation index that helps estimate vegetation health and photosyntehtic activity throughout the growing season. 
  It is more directly related to plant phenology compared to other vegetation indices like NDVI, and does not saturate in high biomass conditions. 
  It is computed with near infrared reflectance, which is strongly reflected by healthy vegetation. You can read more about the phenology layers [here](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/dataset-catalog)."

  bands:
    label: Bands
    description: |
      Bands of interest for the calculations. 
      - Start of season date (SOSD) - date when the vegetation growing season starts, when the PPI value reaches 25% of the season amplitude during the green-up period.
      - End of season date (EOSD) - the date when the vegetation growing season ends in the time profile of the PPI. Occurs when the PPI value reaches 15% of the season ampltitude during the green-down period.
      - Start of season value (SOSV) - the value of the PPI at the start of the vegetation growing season
      - End of season value (EOSV) - the value of the PPI at the end of the vegetation growing season
      - Season maximum value (MAXV) - the maximum (peak) value that the PPI reaches during the vegetation growing season
      - Season maximum date (MAXD) - date in the vegetation growing season where the mximum PPI is reached
      - Season minimum value (MINV) - average PPI of minima of left adn right sides of each season
      - Season amplitude (AMPL) - difference between the maximum and minimum PPI values reached during the season
      - Season length (LENGTH) - number of days between the start and end dates of the vegetation growing season
      - Slope of the green-up period (LSLOPE) - the rate of change in the values of PPI at the day when the vegetation growing season starts
      - Slope of the green-down period (RSLOPE) - the rate of change in tha values of PPO at the dat when the vegetatio growing season ends
      - Seasonal productivity (SPROD) - growing season integral computed as sum of all daily PPI values between the dates of the season start and end, minus their base level.
      - Total productivity (TPROD) - the growing season integral computed as sum of all daily PPI values between the dates of the season start and end
      - Quality flag (QFLAG) - quality indicator assisting users with the screening of clouds, shadows from clouds and topography, other dark areas, snow and water surfaces in their analysis of the PPI dataset
