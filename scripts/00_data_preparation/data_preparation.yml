    description: "eBird Basic Dataset (EBD). This is a tab-separated text file, released monthly, containing all validated raw eBird observations and associated metadata at the time of release. Each row corresponds to the sightings of a single species within a checklist and in addition contains information about the individuals observed and the conditions under which the checklist was constructed.

    description: "Text string with the complete path location for the spatial file to the study area's raster image (TIFF format) with WGS_1984 geographic coordinate system. This file comes from the 'studyarea_to_grid' step and is use to plot the study area in Bon in a Box and should be used when biological data coordinates are in WGS_1984 geographic coordinate system. It provides a geographical grid to the study area to define the sites for occupancy modelling."
