ProtConn measures the percent of a given country or region that is conserved and  managed through well-connected protected areas. This is an important indicator for assessing progress  towards Goal A and Target 3 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which aim to have  30% of land area protected by a network of well-connected protected areas by 2030. The pipeline uses the MK_ProtConn function in the 'Makurhini' package to calculate protconn for different dispersal distances.\n## Uses\nProtConn can be used to assess current progress towards Goal A and Target 3 of the the GBF.  The pipeline can also be used to compare the connectedness of different proposed protected areas,  assisting with planning and design.\n## Pipeline limitations \n* On larger datasets, the pipeline is slow and uses a lot of memory, especially with larger input dispersal distances. \n* Currently, the pipeline does not take into account landscape resistance (ie. whether areas between  protected areas are easily traversed by species) \n## Before you start \nTo use this pipeline, you’ll need a [Protected Planet API key](https://api.protectedplanet.net/request) to access data on the World Database of Protected Areas. If you would like to run the pipeline  with custom protected area data, ensure your data is in GeoPackage format and use the `ProtConn  Analysis with custom PAs` pipeline.\n\n\n Click [here](https://boninabox.geobon.org/indicator?i=ProtConn) for more information about parameterizing and running the pipeline",
