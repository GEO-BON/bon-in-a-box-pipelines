#### Reviewed by: Reviewer names

*This is a template for creating a tutorial for a pipeline, which will be included in the online documentation. These are the suggested sections, but the contributor can include additional sections or change titles if desired.* 

## Introduction
*Write an introduction here that is a brief description of what the pipeline does, and the context in which it should be used. This should include any relevant citations to the original paper.*

## Before you start
*Write any necessary data, API keys, or anything else that the user may need before they run the pipeline*

## Pipeline steps
*Explain the pipeline steps (i.e. scripts) here so the user understands what each step is doing. This can include diagrams or screenshots if it will help the user. This should include information about how to understand the results.*

For example:
### Pipeline inputs
Thiese are the inputs of the pipeline.

### 1. Retrieving the data
This step retrieves data from this place using this API. 

### 2. Cleaning the data
This step uses this package to clean the data for this reason. 

### 3. Analyzing the data
This step analyzes this data to produce this indicator. This is how it works. 

Etc.

### Pipeline outputs
These are the outputs of the pipeline.

## Example
*Include an example of a pipeline run here. If possible, this should be the same as the example that autofills in the pipeline so the user can easily run it and see the results. Include images of the outputs here so that the user can get an idea of what it they should look like*

## Pipeline parameterization
*Write guidance on how to parameterize the pipeline, what types of data to use, and if there are any limitations that should be communicated*

## Troubleshooting
*Write any common errors or issues that came out in the testing phase and how to fix them.*
