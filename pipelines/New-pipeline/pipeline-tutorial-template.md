*This is a template for creating a tutorial for a pipeline, which will be included in the online documentation. These are the suggested sections, but the contributor can include additional sections or change titles if desired.* 

## Introduction
*Write an introduction here that is a brief description of what the pipeline does, and the context in which it should be used. This should include any relevant citations to the original paper.*

## Pipeline limitations
*Describe any limitations to the pipeline that should be communicated.*

## Before you start
*Write any necessary data, API keys, or anything else that the user may need before they run the pipeline.*

## Running the pipeline
*Explain the pipeline steps (i.e. scripts) here so the user understands what each step is doing. This can include diagrams or screenshots if it will help the user. This should include information about how to understand the results.*

### *For example:*
### Pipeline inputs

- **Input 1:** *description of input 1 and what it means.*

- **Input 2:** *description of input 2 and what it means.*

- **Input 3:** *description of input 3 and what it means.*

#### **1. Retrieving the data**
This step retrieves data from this place using this API. 

#### **2. Cleaning the data**
This step uses this package to clean the data for this reason. 

#### **3. Analyzing the data**
This step analyzes this data to produce this indicator. This is how it works. 

Etc.

### Pipeline outputs

- **Output 1:** *description of output 1 and what it means.*

- **Output 2:** *description of output 2 and what it means.*

- **Output 3:** *description of output 3 and what it means.*

## Example
*Include an example of a pipeline run here by inserting a link for the sample run and expected outputs. If possible, the inputs should be the same as the example that autofills in the pipeline so the user can easily run it and see the results.*

**Sample run:** *Insert a link to the results of the pipeline run using the default parameters.*

**Expected outputs:** *Insert a link to the results viewer yielded by the sample run.*

## Troubleshooting
*Write any common errors or issues that came out in the testing phase and how to fix them.*
**Common errors:**

- `Error 1`: *description*
- `Error 2`: *description*


## References
*Add your references here.*
